# Project 3: Crafty Farmer
Plant fruits, vegetables, and ...meat?
How you grow your plants matters; take steps to process the food before it finishes growing. Eg. for growing wheat, if you don't water it for a few days and then crush it,
it will turn into flower.
Choose to harvest the item in it's intermediate state or continue crafting.
Combine/breed items by growing two plants near each other.
Unlock access to new seeds (ingredient checkpoints), to make longer recipies easier.

Goal: Make all of the food items in the game.
