# Crafty Farmer
## Project Description
Plant fruits, vegetables, and ...meat?

How you grow your plants matters; take steps to process the food before it finishes growing. Eg. when growing wheat, if you crush it, it will turn into flower.

Combine two plants by dragging one on the other.

Choose to harvest the item in it's intermediate state or continue crafting.

Unlock access to new seeds (ingredient checkpoints), to make longer recipies easier.

Goal: Grow all food items in the game.
Keep an encyclopedia of all successfully grown foods (shows progress until completion)

## Roadmap:
#### HIGH PRIORITY
- Choose what growable to Plant *
- Craft new growables by dragging one plant onto another *
- Ability to compost spoiled Plants *
- Harvest Plants *
#### medium priority
- Unlock access new seeds *
- Tool selecting (watering can; compost) *
- Keep an encyclopedia (with UI) of all successfully grown Growables (shows progress until completion) *\
#### low priority
- Plants have grace period before starting to spoil
- Plant visuals overhau
#### *extras*
